= Working on SimpleSolr

I appreciate the effort! GitHub offers excellent tools for collaborating
on projects, and the basic fork/branch/pull request style is just fine.

To get started, also no surprises:

1. gem install bundler (if you haven't already)
2. bundle
4. rake


== Database

SimpleSolr uses an in-memory SQLite database. This is more to satisfy
ActiveRecord than for SimpleSolr, but it's so fast it does not matter.
